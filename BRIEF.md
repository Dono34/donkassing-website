## Design Direction: "Not Another White Website"

Dark, immersive, scroll-driven — stands out from the typical clean/minimal executive site.

### Dark Foundation with Depth
- Rich dark background (dark navy/charcoal, not pure black) with subtle SVG noise texture
- Content emerges from darkness — premium, cinematic feel

### Scroll-Triggered Storytelling
- Sections animate in on scroll (fade, slide, parallax) via GSAP ScrollTrigger
- Career arc unfolds like a narrative, not a bullet list
- Key numbers (347% ROI, $900MM, etc.) count up when entering viewport

### Bold Typography as Design
- Oversized statement headlines — name and key phrases become visual elements
- Variable font weights for dramatic contrast
- Text reveal animations on scroll (letter/word appearance)

### Interactive Venture Cards
- Hover-triggered 3D tilt effect (CSS perspective + transform)
- Cursor-following subtle parallax on hero elements

### Cinematic Hero Section
- Headshot with dramatic lighting/gradient treatment
- Tagline types itself or reveals word by word
- Subtle animated gradient or particle effect in background

### Horizontal Scroll Section
- Career timeline or key accomplishments as horizontal scroll within vertical page

### Micro-Interactions
- Buttons glow, links have smooth underline draws, cards lift on hover
- Page feels alive but not distracting

---

## Tech Stack

- Pure HTML5 / CSS3 / vanilla JavaScript
- GSAP (ScrollTrigger) — single lightweight library for scroll animations
- Google Fonts (1-2 fonts max)
- No frameworks, no build steps, no heavy dependencies
- Fast load, SEO-friendly, easily indexable
- Cloudflare Workers deploy with `exit 0` build command

## Testimonials

### Rick C. (Nov 2022 — Upwork)
"I have worked with Don on over half a dozen Amazon projects since 2015, leading my clients and brands to Don's company for services that range from fixing a broken Amazon business to sheer brand presence and growth strategy. I would not work with anyone else for Amazon. Don's knowledge of the Amazon platform and the services he provides cover the gamut. Don is extremely reliable and easy to work with. He gets results. Don offers his services either a la carte or in a full-service management option which is day-to-day management of overall Amazon business. This includes listing optimization, ad planning, bi-weekly performance reviews for sales and ads as well as handling customer service issues and forecasting."

### Client Review #2 (Upwork)
"This is the 2nd time working with Don. A few adjectives to describe my experience: Quick, effective, beautifully designed, and on point for brand story telling. We successfully executed the BrandStory for our brand on Amazon. Don is top-notch to work with. Easy going, responsive, and just an excellent person to work with."

### Client Review #4 (Upwork)
"Don knows his stuff about Amazon! He was very helpful in educating me on where my PPC was unprofitable. I will definitely use his services in the future. 5 STAR EXPERIENCE!"

### Client Review #5 (Upwork)
"I worked with Don as my Amazon Coach and it was an awesome experience! He taught me how to create a successful private label and gave me a lot of valuable tips. Don knows his stuff when it comes to Amazon and he explained everything in a way that made sense. He showed me how to do market research the right way, identify trends, and analyze competitors. It was super helpful! Thanks to Don's guidance, I was able to avoid some big mistakes and not lose money. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for an Amazon Coach who cares about their success. Don is the real deal!"
